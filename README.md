# cytoNet

Network analysis of cell communities

## Introduction
cytoNet is a cloud-based image analysis software designed to quantify the structure of cell communities from microscope images using principles of graph theory.

The cytoNet web interface can be accessed [here](https://www.qutublab.org/cytonet). Instructions on using the web interface can be found [here](http://sample-env-1.myiusswm4v.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/UserGuide.pdf)

If you use cytoNet, please refer to and cite our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/180273)

## Setup
The scripts in this repository were developed in `MATLAB 2021a`. To use standalone scripts as part of your analysis, clone the repository and add the directory and sub-directories to your path. To perform spatial analysis, run the scripts in the `SpatialNetworkAnalysis` folder. To perform functional analysis, run the scripts in the `FunctionalNetworkAnalysis` folder.
