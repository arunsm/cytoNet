% Function to generate a cuttoff correlation value by scrambling each data set, 
% finding all correlation coefficients, and then using the a percentile of the
% set of coefficients as the cutoff value
% INPUT: timeSeries - (nxm) matrix where n is the number of cells and m is
% the number of time points; cutoffPercentile - percentile of scrambled
% correlation coefficients to use as cutoff; M - maximum lag over which to
% calculate cross-correlation values (if M is 0, this becomes the Pearson
% correlation)
